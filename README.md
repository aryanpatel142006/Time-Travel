# ⏳ Temporal Displacement Interface
"Genesis Event: Timeline established."
## 🚀 Launch Sequence
Initiate Time Travel here: https://time-travelling.vercel.app/

## 🌌 Mission Brief

This is a high-performance visual simulation of a Time Machine, built to explore the boundaries of web-based graphics. It features a retro-futuristic UI, neon synthwave aesthetics, and a "Temporal Displacement" core that reacts to user input.

The interface is reminds you of sci-fi terminals, complete with pixel fonts, glowing cyan data readouts, and infinite tunneling visuals.

## ⚠️ System Requirements (CRITICAL)
DETECTED ANOMALY: Safari Browser
STATUS: UNSUPPORTED

This project utilizes TypeGPU for hardware acceleration. Due to the intense GPU flux required to bend spacetime:

❌ Safari: Containment Failure. (Not supported due to WebGPU limitations)

✅ Chrome/Edge/Brave: Stable. (Highly Recommended)

If you access this via Safari, a custom yellow "System Alert" HUD will guide you to a compatible vessel.
